## 👩🏻‍💻 Bianca Negri
Early-career professional bridging AI education and neuroscience analytics. I build productivity tools and automations in Python/Streamlit with Gemini/OpenAI. 

Currently, I'm focused on two main areas:
1.  **Practical AI Applications:** Developing tools that use LLMs to automate tasks and generate insights.
2.  **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Creating reproducible, step-by-step study guides as I learn PyTorch and the fundamentals of TinyML.

### What I'm building now

- **[AI-Powered Report Generator](https://github.com/biancanegribello/report-generator-ai)**: A Streamlit web application to extract insights and generate text summaries using Large Language Models. The goal is to build a productivity tool that demonstrates the practical application of AI APIs.

### What I'm learning now

- **[PyTorch Study Notebooks](https://github.com/biancanegribello/pytorch-notebooks)**: Documenting my deep learning journey. The goal is to create practical, well-commented guides on tensors, gradients, and building basic models in PyTorch.
